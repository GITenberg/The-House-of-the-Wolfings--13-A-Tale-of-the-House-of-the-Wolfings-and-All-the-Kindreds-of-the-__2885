description: "A Tale of the House of the Wolfings and All the Kindreds of the Mark\
  \ is a fantasy novel by William Morris, perhaps the first modern fantasy writer\
  \ to unite an imaginary world with the element of the supernatural, and thus the\
  \ precursor of much of present-day fantasy literature. It was first published in\
  \ hardcover by Reeves and Turner in 1889.\nThe book influenced J. R. R. Tolkien's\
  \ popular The Lord of the Rings.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
